CS321 Team 11: The UsersProject Name: Challenge of The GridGame Requirements:- The Game is to be opened using NetBeans IDE with Java 22.0.2.- The Game utilizes LibGDX and as such will be using an older version of Gradle.Installation of the Game:	The Tron.zip file should be imported into NetBeans first.The IDE wil have specific warnings due to LibGDX using an older version of Gradle you should click resolve on these issues. You can click resolve on the core, lwjgl file and the tron file if they appear from there you can close the window. From here the lwjgl3 file can be run if it is not alreadyone of the opened folders on the left, the Tron folder should hold the file.Playing the Game:	From there the program generates the project and will load the 64 by 64 grid with the players loaded into each corner. Players 1-4, are spawned in order from the bottom left, top left, bottom right, and top right, respectively. The controls are player specific from 1 to 4. Player 1 uses W,A,S and D for up down left right, with variants of for players 2, 3 and 4. Player 2 uses T,G F, H and Player 3 uses I,K, J, and L while the final player utilizes the arrow keys. Players once they choose direction can move in each cardinal direction and will leave a trail on the grid. The trail is an obstacle for every player and collisions into different players, trails and walls will result in a crash. The crash stops a player’s bike, eliminating them from the game. The game ends when there is only one last surviving player and the player can choose to fill the grid if they wish.  Reseting the Game: To reset the playing field, the user will have to relaunch the game for now.
